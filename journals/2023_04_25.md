The path to success for many social platforms has often gone the same way.

(Even some successful platforms never hit that last step.)

The change they imagine still requires a lot of user education — and a lot of work to make this stuff work for users. But the fundamental shift, from platforms to protocols, appears to have momentum in a way it never has before.
