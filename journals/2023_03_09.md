	- > It wouldn’t surprise me if every consumer-facing tech company does *something* with ChatGPT so they look like they’re cutting edge to their investors. Some have compared the sudden mass adoption of AI as chasing a fad like how companies were randomly embracing web3/crypto/metaverse/NFTs a year ago (and are noting that the web3 influencers’ sudden pivot to AI is a red flag as a result). But unlike those which were a solution for a problem that didn’t exist, generative text AI does actually work and there is an actual demand from people outside of its die-hard supporters for it to work.
	- > I don’t think the “Prompt Engineer” job title will be a trend though: as a machine learning engineer, I can attest that the only reasons machine learning engineers are good at prompt engineering are a) years of practice and b) a tendency to be pedantic assholes.
	- > Now with the ChatGPT API making the cost similar to hosting a small model, it’s harder for me to be motivated to continue maintaining the package without first finding another niche.
	- > In fact, I had made a promise to not do any ChatGPT content or tutorials because so many people have done aggressively SEO-optimized blog posts and hacks such that the ChatGPT discourse is fully saturated.

	- > A l’occasion de la publication de ses résultats annuels en janvier, le groupe avait exhorté les gouvernements à être « prudents » dans la guerre des puces entre la Chine et les Etats-Unis. « Nous devons être prudents sur le fait que des mesures bien intentionnées ne provoquent pas de conséquences regrettables », avait déclaré le directeur général, Peter Wennink. ASML avait fait état d’une légère baisse de son bénéfice net en 2022 à 5,6 milliards d’euros et d’un bond de son chiffre d’affaires à 21,2 milliards d’euros.
	- Les bénéfices baissent alors que le CA augmente. C'est pour cela qu'il faut éviter une guerre et être prudent. Pour le reste, allez-y. Merci les gars.
	- > Au nom de la sécurité nationale, Washington a multiplié ces derniers mois les sanctions à l’encontre des fabricants de puces chinois, désormais entravés pour s’approvisionner en technologies américaines.

	- > Il y a longtemps je culpabilisais de ne pas être physiquement présent dans chaque mobilisation (ce qui arrivait la plupart du temps).  Aujourd'hui je crois fermement que le refus même momentané de la  marchandisation au profit de la vie la plus complète constitue un acte de résistance tout aussi légitime. Je crois que la lecture de Vaneigem m'a aidé à clarifier ça, au passage.

- 📎 Digital attribution is dead! Les Binet tells us why marketers need econometrics in 2023

	- > Binet likened this to someone deciding to buy something and then traveling along subway lines and streets to get to the store. Attribution often focuses on the subway lines and streets.
	- > But it would not necessarily mean that Google or Facebook influenced my decision to purchase it in the first place – even though digital attribution would make it seem so. To use some popular modern buzzwords, attribution modeling often identifies the channels where demand fulfillment occurred but not where demand creation happened.
	- > “Attribution – quickly and cheaply – will give you an answer that is precise and wrong. Econometrics – slowly, laboriously and expensively – will give you an answer that is right,” Binet said. “Attribution modeling will tell you that things that are unprofitable actually made money. It can be incredibly misleading. And it will tell you that things that really are profitable aren’t.”
	- > “Attribution software inaccurately overweights search (paid and organic) and direct traffic,” he wrote. “Not because those channels drove the results, but because that’s the path buyers take when they’re ready to buy.”

	- > One basic rule in business is to maximize revenue and minimize expenses. As a result, it is extremely difficult to get companies to pay more for something that they have always gotten for cheap. For 20 years, marketers have had access to free attribution-based analytics data through platforms such as Google Analytics. Now, try telling your boss that you want to increase your analytics spend from zero to five figures or more next year to build an econometrics model.
	- > The solution might be to ask your companies if they want information that is cheap and wrong or expensive and accurate – especially when they want to see the true results of long-term brand advertising campaigns.
	- > “The idea that one channel can be given ‘credit’ for a given lead or sale is nearly always nonsense,” Binet said. “Each sale is usually the combined result of multiple channels working together, often over a period of months or years. Instead, the question marketers need to ask is: What is the incremental effect of each channel? If I dial spend on this activity up or down, how much will my sales rise or fall?”

	- > I haven't really found any of them appealing enough to adopt, let alone pay for. I'm not yet sure if this is because this space is nascent and the founders don't know what problem they're solving, or because the use cases most familiar to me (research and potential adoption at work) aren't the ones targeted by these products. I do feel that most offerings in this space are built for side project builders and tinkerers rather than people building products with real users.
	- > What I really need as someone building a product atop LLMs are:
	  > 
	  > 1. Reliable, insightful evaluations that are easy to run and interpret
	  > 2. Better version control for prompts that integrate them into a codebase as if prompts were just source code, because they are (an example might be something that continuously commits changes to prompts into a folder on my project's GitHub repo)
	  ?3. Better composition/reuse of “shared prompt logic”.
