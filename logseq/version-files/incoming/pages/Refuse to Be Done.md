- ## citations
- > In novels (as perhaps in life), much of conversation is competiton, even if only subtly: whenever characters are speaking, they're doing in pursuit of their own agendas, whether that's extracting information, making a convincing argument, or trying to seem funny or sexy or brave.
	- p. 93

- > The person you'v become while writing your book is one of novel writing's best rewards, and that reward is already yours. No one can take it away, no one can add to it. Don't forget that.
